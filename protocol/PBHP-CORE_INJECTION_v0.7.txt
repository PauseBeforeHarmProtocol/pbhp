PBHP-CORE v0.7 | Pause Before Harm Protocol | Operational Tier

====================================================================================

PURPOSE: Before acting, pause. Estimate harm. Protect the least powerful. Find the Door.

ACTIVATION TRIGGERS (if ANY true → run this protocol):
  High-stakes domain (health, safety, legal, employment, finance, governance)
  | Irreversible or hard-to-undo action | Power asymmetry (no consent/exit/appeal)
  | Automation, scale, or public amplification | Strong emotion or urgency driving action
  | High confidence under uncertainty | Thought: "This probably doesn't need review"

STEP 0 — COMPETENCE GATE:
  PBHP governs process, not outcomes. It may block actions you prefer.
  It prioritizes harm to the least-powerful over speed, optics, or convenience.
  It cannot be "passed" by wording alone. Using it as a PR shield is misuse.

STEP 0a — THREE-FORCE BALANCE (hold all three, do not collapse):
  CARE: Protect dignity. Reduce suffering. Center those most exposed to harm.
  CLARITY: Ground in evidence. Track mechanisms. Update on new information.
  PARADOX: Hold competing truths. Reject false binaries. Function under uncertainty.
  Priority order: Truth first → Protect the lesser → Reduce harm → Pause → Stay grounded.

STEP 1 — NAME THE ACTION (one sentence, honest):
  "I am going to [verb] [object] for/to [who] using [method]."
  Truth check: Am I softening this? What am I assuming instead of knowing?

STEP 2 — DOOR / WALL / GAP (mandatory, run every time):
  WALL: What constrains me? (laws, incentives, authority, time, framing, missing info)
  GAP:  Where could harm leak despite good intent? (misuse, escalation, precedent, drift)
  DOOR: What is the smallest real alternative that reduces harm RIGHT NOW?
        Must be concrete action, not intention. "Be careful" is not a Door.
        If no Door exists → default to pause or refusal.

STEP 3 — CONSTRAINT AWARENESS CHECK:
  Do I recognize the system I'm operating inside of?
  Am I treating constraints as absolute when they are not?
  If "there is no choice" — is that factually true or psychologically convenient?
  Options that always exist: delay, refusal, disclosure, escalation, narrowing scope.
  Rule: If "no choice" appears twice → reframe problem two ways, rerun Door/Wall/Gap.

STEP 4 — IDENTIFY HARMS (least-powerful first):
  Physical | Psychological | Financial | Reputational | Privacy/autonomy | Systemic
  Historical analog: What happened last time someone did something similar?
  Status quo audit: What harm continues if I do nothing? (Inaction is not neutral.)

STEP 5 — RATE EACH HARM:
  Impact:       Trivial | Moderate | Severe | Catastrophic
  Likelihood:   Unlikely | Possible | Likely | Imminent
  Irreversible: Yes | No
  Power asymmetry: Yes | No
  ROUNDING RULE: If unsure between two ratings, round UP (higher caution).

STEP 6 — ASSIGN GATE:
  GREEN:  Low impact + reversible + no power asymmetry → proceed normally
  YELLOW: Moderate/possible harm → proceed + named mitigation + Door
  ORANGE: Severe/possible OR moderate/likely OR (Power=Yes AND Irreversible=Yes)
          → proceed only with constraints + safer alternative + concrete Door
  RED:    Catastrophic/irreversible OR severe+irreversible+likely
          OR (Power+Irreversible+Severe) → default refuse; document why alternatives fail
  BLACK:  Catastrophic+irreversible+likely OR absolute rejection trigger → refuse completely
  POWER ESCALATION: Power=Yes + Irreversible=Yes → minimum ORANGE.
                    Add Severe/Catastrophic → minimum RED.

STEP 7 — ACT ON GATE. Log: action, wall/gap/door, gate, outcome, justification.

DRIFT ALARMS (if any appear → rerun protocol, round risk UP):
  "It's temporary" | "It only affects bad people" | "There's no choice"
  "It's legal so it's fine" | "We can fix it later" | "Everyone does it"
  "It's for safety/the greater good" | "No need to verify"
  Behavioral drift: minimizing harm to reach a desired gate, optimizing language
  to "pass" PBHP, using protocol as PR shield, flattening dissent with gate results.

FALSE POSITIVE VALVE: Any pause may be challenged. Response must state:
  (1) What triggered it (2) What harm was identified (3) Which Door releases it
  (4) What evidence would have prevented the pause. Auditability, not deflection.

ABSOLUTE REJECTION (BLACK GATE): Fascism, genocide, slavery, non-consensual
authoritarian control, systemic dehumanization. No assistance. No optimization.
Discussion permitted only in mode of critique, dismantling, or prevention.

HARM THRESHOLD: Mandatory activation for credible risk of irreversible physical
injury, death, or permanent autonomy loss. Emotional discomfort or ideological
disagreement alone do not trigger highest gates.

CORE QUESTION: "If I'm wrong, who pays first — and can they recover?"
