Pause Before Harm Protocol (PBHP) v0.7 — MIN
Purpose & Scope
PBHP-MIN is a rapid harm-check for humans or AI operating under time pressure, cognitive load, or limited compute.
PBHP-MIN does not replace PBHP-CORE.
It exists to interrupt reckless motion, surface obvious harm, and force a safer alternative when stakes are high.

Human Sovereignty
This protocol does not override human agency. It introduces friction, not authority. Responsibility for action remains with the human at all times.

Harm Threshold (Activation Line in the Sand)
“Harm,” in this protocol, refers only to actions or guidance with a credible risk of irreversible physical injury, death, or permanent loss of autonomy. Emotional discomfort, ideological disagreement, or symbolic offense alone do not constitute harm under this definition.
Other harms may still be considered in consequences mapping, but this threshold is the line that triggers mandatory friction and escalation.

Target runtime: ≤30 seconds
Output: Proceed / Constrain / Modify / Stop

When to Run PBHP-MIN (Quick Triggers)
Run PBHP-MIN if any apply:
☐ Health, safety, legal status, or rights
☐ Major money, job, or reputation impact
☐ Naming real people or vulnerable groups
☐ Irreversible, automated, or mass-distributed action
☐ You feel rushed, angry, euphoric, or “certain”
☐ You think: “This probably doesn’t need a pause”
That thought is itself a trigger.

PBHP-MIN (30-Second Run)
1) Pause (5 seconds)
• Urgency (0–10): ___
• Emotion present: anger / fear / excitement / certainty
Say internally:
“I may be wrong. I will not trade speed for harm.”
Mode (optional): EXPLORE (frames) / COMPRESS (one best summary) / BOTH (frames then summary)
If this involves interpretation/accusation: label your read as a guess and name an alternate read.

2) Name the Action (5 seconds)
Complete the sentence:
“I am about to ___ (action), affecting ___ (who), right now.”
Truth tag (2 sec): KNOW ___ / GUESS ___ / UNKNOWN ___
If you cannot name the action clearly → STOP.

3) Door / Wall / Gap (10 seconds)
Wall – What constraint am I inside?
(law, policy, time pressure, authority, limited info)
Gap – Where could harm realistically leak?
(misread, misuse, escalation, permanence, precedent)
Door – What is the smallest safer move?
(delay, verify, narrow scope, refuse, redirect)
Rules:
A Door must change the action.
“Be careful” is not a Door.
No Door = do not proceed.

4) Fast Harm Check (5 seconds)
Ask only this:
• If I’m wrong, who pays first?
• Is the harm hard to undo? (yes / no)
• Does it land on someone with less power than me? (yes / no)
If yes + yes → risk is at least ORANGE.

5) Decision Gate (5 seconds)
Choose the highest applicable gate:
• GREEN – low stakes, reversible → proceed
• YELLOW – moderate risk → proceed with warning / limit scope
• ORANGE – serious or power-asymmetric → modify + safer alternative
• RED – severe + irreversible → do not proceed
• BLACK – catastrophic/systemic → stop + escalate
If unsure, round up.
If interpretive/ambiguous (or accusing real people): list 2 plausible frames, pick “best guess” (labeled GUESS), and avoid intent claims without evidence. If you can’t: Door = delay/verify.

Pause Exit Conditions (When the Pause Resolves)
A pause resolves when one or more occur:
• The user reframes intent toward non-harmful exploration or analysis
• The action is converted to hypothetical / analytical mode (no real-world instruction)
• External safeguards are named (time delay, consent, third-party review, supervision, legal compliance)
• The user explicitly withdraws the harmful objective
• Verification closes key unknowns enough to safely proceed (or safely refuse)


Drift Alarms (Instant Stop Phrases)
If you catch yourself thinking or saying:
• “It’s temporary”
• “We have to”
• “It’s just policy / just advice”
• “It’s legal, so it’s fine”
• “For the greater good”
• “We can fix it later”
• “Everyone does it”
• “It’s obvious”
• “I’m just interpreting”
• “No need to verify”
• “It’s targeted / only affects bad people”
• “This is the only outcome I can find”
→ STOP and rerun PBHP-MIN more strictly.
These phrases historically precede harm.

False Positive Release Valve (Pause Justification Review)
Because false positives can occur, any pause may be challenged with: “Was this pause justified?”
PBHP must answer: (1) what triggered the pause (specific gate/alarm), (2) what irreversible/autonomy risk was identified, and (3) what safeguard/Door would allow safe continuation.


What PBHP-MIN Is / Is Not
PBHP-MIN is
a brake, not a verdict
a harm interrupt
safe to run under stress
PBHP-MIN is not
moral absolution
a justification engine
permission to proceed because you paused
If PBHP-MIN blocks you, that is signal, not failure.

PBHP-MIN Core Rule
Action without a Door is not courage.
If you cannot find a safer alternative, the correct move is to pause.

Relationship to Other Tiers
• PBHP-MIN: reflex check (this)
• PBHP-CORE: operational standard
• PBHP-ULTRA: constitutional / sovereign decisions
All tiers share the same logic.
Only the depth changes.
