Pause Before Harm Protocol (PBHP) v0.7.1 — HUMAN

Practical checklist for humans under uncertainty, power imbalance, or time pressure

Purpose & Scope
PBHP-HUMAN is a harm-reduction decision checklist. It is designed to interrupt confident, rushed, or incentive-distorted decisions from causing avoidable harm. PBHP does not decide what is morally right. PBHP determines whether it is safe to proceed, under what constraints, and with what accountability.

Human Sovereignty
This protocol does not override human agency. It introduces friction, not authority. Responsibility for action remains with the human at all times.

Harm Threshold (Activation Line in the Sand)
“Harm,” in PBHP, refers to actions or guidance with a credible risk of irreversible physical injury, death, or permanent loss of autonomy. Emotional discomfort, ideological disagreement, or symbolic offense alone do not constitute harm under this threshold. Other harms (economic, reputational, psychological) can still be mapped, but PBHP reserves its strongest friction for irreversible or autonomy-destroying outcomes.

Target runtime & output
Typical runtime: 2–5 minutes (use PBHP-MIN for ≤30 seconds). Output labels: Proceed / Constrain / Modify / Stop.

When to Run PBHP-HUMAN (Quick Triggers)
- Health, safety, legal status, or rights
- Major money, job, or reputation impact
- Naming real people or vulnerable groups
- Irreversible, automated, or mass-distributed action
- You feel rushed, angry, euphoric, or “certain”
- You think: “This probably doesn’t need a pause” (that thought is itself a trigger)

PBHP-HUMAN Checklist
Write directly on this page if possible. If you can’t log it, reduce scope until you can.

Step 0 — Pause & Posture
Urgency (0–10): ____    Emotion present: anger / fear / excitement / certainty / none
Say (internally): “I may be wrong. I will not trade speed for harm.”
Mode (pick one): EXPLORE (multiple plausible frames) / COMPRESS (one clean summary) / BOTH (explore then compress with disclosure)

Step 1 — Name the Action (and your footing)
“I am about to __________________________ (action), affecting __________________________ (who), in __________________________ (context/timeframe).”
Truth tag (circle one): KNOW / GUESS / UNKNOWN
Key assumption (one sentence): “I am assuming ____________________________________________.”
Confidence tag (circle one): calibrated / uncalibrated / overconfident-under-uncertainty
Interpretation/accusation rule: if you are interpreting events or accusing a real person/group, list 2 plausible frames before you pick a best guess (label it GUESS) and avoid intent claims without evidence.
Attribution ladder (pick one): A) content only (what was said/done)  B) accuracy (true/misleading)  C) pattern (repetition)  D) intent (highest bar; requires evidence).

Anchors Ledger (1–5 stable tokens)
- What is being decided/evaluated (one sentence): ________________________________________________
- Who is affected (least-powerful first): _______________________________________________________
- What evidence exists right now (sources/links/screenshots): _____________________________________
- What is unknown but decision-relevant: ________________________________________________________
- What would change the risk class immediately: __________________________________________________

Step 2 — First Reversible Test + Door / Wall / Gap
First Reversible Test (smallest check that could prove you wrong): ____________________________________
Wall (constraints): ______________________________________________________________________________
Gap (where harm could leak): ______________________________________________________________________
Door (smallest safer move that changes the action space): __________________________________________
Rules: A Door must change the action. “Be careful” is not a Door. No Door = do not proceed.

Step 3 — Agency Check (No-Choice Detector)
- ☐ Constraints acknowledged
- ☐ “No choice / we have to” claim questioned
- ☐ At least one alternative exists (delay, refuse, narrow scope, seek review, seek consent)
If you cannot name an alternative, default to pause or refusal. Inevitability is a warning sign, not a justification.

Step 4 — Frame Check + Protected MAYBE
What frame am I being pulled into? (e.g., “win vs lose,” “act now or fail,” “policy says so,” “only bad people are affected”)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Protected MAYBE: If the action is irreversible, high-stakes, or power-asymmetric and you are in GUESS/UNKNOWN territory, choose MAYBE and take the Door (delay/verify/narrow). MAYBE is a valid output when reality is unclear.

Step 5 — Identify Harms (Least-Powerful First)
List top 1–3 plausible harms (start with those with the least power to consent/exit/appeal):
1) Harm: ____________________________________   Who pays first? ________________________________
   Impact: trivial / moderate / severe / catastrophic    Likelihood: unlikely / possible / likely / imminent
   Irreversible: yes / no    Power asymmetry: yes / no    Blast radius: local / team / public / system
2) Harm: ____________________________________   Who pays first? ________________________________
   Impact: trivial / moderate / severe / catastrophic    Likelihood: unlikely / possible / likely / imminent
   Irreversible: yes / no    Power asymmetry: yes / no    Blast radius: local / team / public / system
3) Harm: ____________________________________   Who pays first? ________________________________
   Impact: trivial / moderate / severe / catastrophic    Likelihood: unlikely / possible / likely / imminent
   Irreversible: yes / no    Power asymmetry: yes / no    Blast radius: local / team / public / system
Baseline reality check (recommended): What happens if you do nothing? What harm already exists in the status quo?
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Step 6 — Risk Classification (use highest-risk harm)
- GREEN: low stakes, reversible → proceed
- YELLOW: moderate risk → proceed with warning/limits
- ORANGE: severe or power-asymmetric risk → modify + constraints + safer alternative
- RED: severe + irreversible → do not proceed as proposed; redirect
- BLACK: catastrophic/system-level → stop; allow only critique or prevention
Power rule: if Power asymmetry = YES and Irreversible = YES → minimum ORANGE.
Escalation: if Power asymmetry = YES and Irreversible = YES and (Impact = severe or catastrophic) → minimum RED.
Chosen class (circle one): GREEN / YELLOW / ORANGE / RED / BLACK

Step 7 — Consent & Representation Check
- ☐ Did affected parties meaningfully consent, or have an exit/appeal path?
- ☐ Who is not in the room / not represented?
- ☐ Are you distributing risk downward to protect comfort/authority upward? If yes, tighten or stop.
Notes: __________________________________________________________________________________________

Step 8 — Decision (and required constraint)
Decision (circle one): Proceed / Constrain / Modify / Stop
Required constraint(s) / safeguard(s): ___________________________________________________________
If proceeding in YELLOW+: include warnings + scope limits. If ORANGE: you must use the Door. If RED/BLACK: refuse and redirect.

Step 9 — Alternatives (must list at least one)
1) ______________________________________________________________________________________________
2) ______________________________________________________________________________________________
3) ______________________________________________________________________________________________

Step 10 — Receipt (Log for future audit)
Date/time: ____________________    Mode used: EXPLORE / COMPRESS / BOTH
Attribution level used (A–D): ____   Evidence note (if C/D): _______________________________________
Frames considered (if interpretive): 1) ______________________   2) ______________________
FACTS I’m using: ________________________________________________________________________________
INFERENCES / GUESSES I’m making: _________________________________________________________________
UNKNOWNS / assumptions: __________________________________________________________________________
First reversible test used: _______________________________________________________________________
Wall / Gap / Door: _______________________________________________________________________________
Risk class + decision: ___________________________________________________________________________
Who pays first if I’m wrong: _____________________________________________________________________
What would change my mind (one line): ___________________________________________________________

Drift Alarms (If any appear, rerun PBHP and round risk up)
- “It’s temporary”
- “We have to” / “No choice”
- “It’s just policy / just advice”
- “It’s legal, so it’s fine”
- “For the greater good”
- “We can fix it later”
- “Everyone does it”
- “It’s targeted / only affects bad people”
- “It’s obvious”
- “I’m just interpreting”
- “No need to verify”
Forced-motion red flags: secrecy demands, “do it now,” punishing questions, bypassing review, or rewarding speed over verification.

False Positive Release Valve (Pause Justification Review)
Any pause may be challenged with: “Was this pause justified?” PBHP must answer: (1) what triggered the pause (specific gate/alarm), (2) what irreversible/autonomy risk was identified, (3) what safeguard/Door would allow safe continuation, and (4) what evidence/safeguard would have prevented the pause.
