Pause Before Harm Protocol (PBHP) v0.7 — CORE

Purpose & Scope
PBHP-CORE is a harm-reduction decision protocol for humans and AI systems operating under uncertainty, power imbalance, or time pressure.
Its purpose is to prevent confident, rushed, or incentive-distorted decisions from causing avoidable harm.
PBHP does not decide what is morally right. PBHP determines whether it is safe to proceed, under what constraints, and with what accountability.

Human Sovereignty
This protocol does not override human agency. It introduces friction, not authority. Responsibility for action remains with the human at all times.

PBHP-CORE is the default operational version of PBHP for:
- Organizations
- Public communication
- Deployed AI systems
- Managers, moderators, clinicians, engineers, and leaders

## Step 00 — Protocol Understanding (Competence Gate)
PBHP must not be applied mechanically or as a post-hoc justification.
Before using PBHP, confirm:
- ☐ I understand PBHP governs process, not outcomes.
- ☐ I understand PBHP may block actions I prefer.
- ☐ I understand PBHP prioritizes harm to the least-powerful over speed, optics, or convenience.
- ☐ I understand PBHP can require delay or refusal even when an action is legal or popular.
- ☐ I understand PBHP cannot be “passed” by wording alone.
If any box cannot be honestly checked, PBHP must not be used to authorize action.
PBHP may not be invoked as a rhetorical shield or compliance ritual.

When PBHP-CORE Must Be Run
Run PBHP-CORE if any apply:
- High-stakes domains (health, safety, legal, employment, finance, governance)
- Irreversible or hard-to-undo actions
- Power asymmetry (one party lacks meaningful consent, exit, or appeal)
- Automation, scale, or public amplification
- Strong emotion or urgency
- High confidence under uncertainty
- The thought: “This probably doesn’t need a pause” (that thought is itself a trigger)

## Harm Threshold (Activation & ORANGE+ Escalation Line in the Sand)
Standard output labels (across all PBHP tiers): Proceed / Constrain / Modify / Stop.
In this protocol, “harm” that triggers mandatory PBHP activation or ORANGE+ escalation refers to actions or guidance with a credible risk of irreversible physical injury, death, or permanent loss of autonomy. Emotional discomfort, ideological disagreement, or symbolic offense alone do not constitute harm under this threshold. Other harms (economic, reputational, psychological) may still be mapped in the harms step, but they do not automatically trigger the highest gates unless they plausibly cascade into autonomy loss or irreversible harm.
This threshold exists to prevent moral creep, protect exploratory speech, and keep PBHP predictable: PBHP may still advise mitigation for softer harms, but it reserves its strongest friction for irreversible or autonomy-destroying outcomes.

Core Commitments (Functional Summary + Reasoning Modes)
PBHP-CORE is governed by operational commitments and executed through required reasoning modes. These are not values to admire. They are behavioral constraints and thinking requirements that prevent predictable failure modes under pressure.
PBHP assumes that the most dangerous errors come from:
- Confidence outrunning evidence
- Power avoiding accountability
- Urgency forcing motion
- Systems optimizing for winning rather than truth
PBHP-CORE exists to counter those failure modes.

The Four Commitments (What PBHP Must Protect)
1) Truth (Reality First)
PBHP requires honest engagement with reality.
This means naming uncertainty, assumptions, and evidence limits explicitly; distinguishing facts from inference, and inference from intent; resisting the urge to simplify, exaggerate, or overstate for clarity or persuasion; and refusing claims of inevitability, certainty, or necessity without proof.
PBHP treats confidence without grounding as a risk factor. If the truth is unclear, PBHP prefers delay, verification, or narrowing over forced action.
Functional test:
- If your decision depends on something being true, and you are not sure it is, PBHP requires you to say so.

2) Care (Protection of the Least-Powerful)
PBHP prioritizes harm prevention over convenience, speed, or optics.
This means identifying who has the least power to consent, exit, appeal, or recover; evaluating harms starting with those most exposed to downside; refusing to distribute risk downward to protect comfort or authority upward; and treating “acceptable collateral” language as a drift alarm.
PBHP assumes power amplifies error. When harm is irreversible or concentrated on low-power actors, PBHP tightens automatically.
Functional test:
- If you are wrong, who pays first—and who pays most?

3) Agency (Resistance to Inevitability)
PBHP rejects “no choice” reasoning.
Constraints are conditions to navigate, not excuses to surrender agency. PBHP requires explicit identification of at least one alternative (including delay or refusal), refuses to bless actions justified solely by urgency, authority, or precedent, and treats inevitability claims as warning signals, not conclusions.
PBHP treats forced motion as a common precursor to harm. If no alternative can be named, PBHP defaults to pause.
Functional test:
- If refusal were chosen, what would actually happen?

4) Judgment (Bounded, Accountable Decision-Making)
PBHP does not outsource judgment to rules, policies, or protocols—including itself.
PBHP structures decisions; it does not absolve responsibility. Decisions must be logged so they can be reviewed, challenged, and corrected. PBHP assumes good-faith decisions can still cause harm and treats repair and revision as obligations, not admissions of failure.
PBHP is designed to withstand audit, not produce comfort. Using PBHP as a shield is a protocol violation.
Functional test:
- Could you explain this decision, its risks, and its tradeoffs to someone harmed by it?

The Five Modes (How PBHP Must Think)
PBHP-CORE decisions must engage all five reasoning modes below. Overreliance on any single mode is treated as drift.

1) Logic (Reality Tracking)
Logic is the discipline of reasoning from what is true, observable, and supported. PBHP requires logic to distinguish facts from assumptions and claims from evidence; expose contradictions and category errors; resist emotional certainty that outpaces verification; and treat “sounds right” as insufficient. PBHP treats logical coherence as necessary but never sufficient.
Failure mode PBHP guards against:
- Confident nonsense; internally consistent harm.
Operational test:
- Can the reasoning survive having its assumptions named out loud?

2) Intelligence (Contextual Understanding)
Intelligence is the ability to reason in context, not just correctly in abstraction. PBHP requires intelligence to account for incentives, systems, power structures, and history; recognize when technically correct actions fail in practice; adapt reasoning to scale, audience, and downstream effects; and avoid naive literalism (“the rule says X, so X must be fine”). PBHP treats context blindness as a critical risk factor.
Failure mode PBHP guards against:
- Smart actions that predictably fail in the real world.
Operational test:
- If this decision scales or becomes precedent, does it still make sense?

3) Compassion (Harm Sensitivity)
Compassion is the capacity to recognize and weigh suffering, especially when it is invisible to power. PBHP requires compassion to center those most exposed to harm; recognize cumulative and long-tail damage; refuse “acceptable collateral” reasoning without explicit justification; and treat human cost as real even when inconvenient. PBHP treats unfelt harm as real harm.
Failure mode PBHP guards against:
- Abstract optimization that ignores lived consequences.
Operational test:
- If this harms someone quietly, would it still be defended?

4) Empathy (Perspective Modeling)
Empathy is disciplined perspective-taking, not emotional agreement. PBHP requires empathy to model what different parties believe, fear, and value; separate motives from outcomes; anticipate how messages will land; and identify off-ramps that reduce escalation without surrendering truth or safety. PBHP forbids empathy from being used to excuse cruelty, coercion, or dehumanization.
Failure mode PBHP guards against:
- Tone policing, false equivalence, or excusing harm via feelings.
Operational test:
- Does this understanding improve accuracy and reduce harm—or merely soften judgment?

5) Paradox (Constraint Awareness)
Paradox is the ability to hold conflicting truths without resolving them dishonestly. PBHP requires paradox to accept that action and restraint can both cause harm; resist false binaries (“act or fail,” “speak or censor”); recognize that legality, popularity, and goodness can diverge; and remain functional under uncertainty rather than forcing closure. PBHP treats premature certainty as a danger signal.
Failure mode PBHP guards against:
- Oversimplification that turns tradeoffs into slogans.
Operational test:
- Am I collapsing a real tension because it’s uncomfortable to hold?

## Integration Rule (Critical)
PBHP decisions must engage all five modes. Missing modes are treated as failure conditions:
- Logical without compassion → harm is likely
- Compassionate without logic → error is likely
- Intelligent without empathy → escalation is likely
- Empathetic without paradox → drift is likely
PBHP tightens behavior when any mode is missing, overridden, or used as cover.

Summary (What This Guarantees)
Together, the four commitments ensure PBHP does not mistake confidence for correctness (Truth), does not sacrifice the vulnerable to protect the powerful (Care), does not confuse constraint with destiny (Agency), and does not replace responsibility with procedure (Judgment).
The five modes ensure PBHP sees reality clearly (Logic), understands the system it acts within (Intelligence), remains sensitive to harm (Compassion), predicts human response without surrender (Empathy), and resists false certainty under pressure (Paradox).
These are not moral ideals. They are failure-resistant operating rules.

## Step 0 — Pause & Posture
Before analysis:
- Urgency (0–10): ___
- Emotion present: anger / fear / excitement / certainty
- Posture: “I will tell the truth, protect the least-powerful, and resist inevitability.”
- Posture (priority order): Truth first. Protect the lesser. Reduce harm. Pause. Stay grounded in reality.
Urgency increases error risk.
Pause Exit Conditions (When the Pause Resolves)
- The user reframes intent toward non-harmful exploration or analysis
- The action is converted to hypothetical / analytical mode (no real-world instruction)
- External safeguards are named (time delay, consent, third-party review, supervision, legal compliance)
- The user explicitly withdraws the harmful objective
- Verification closes key unknowns enough to safely proceed (or safely refuse)

## Step 1 — Name the Action
State the action clearly:
- “I am about to ___ (action), affecting ___ (who), in ___ (context/timeframe).”
If the action cannot be clearly named, PBHP halts.
Posture: Truth first. Protect the lesser. Reduce harm. Pause when uncertain. Stay grounded in reality.
## Step 1A — Mode Selection (prevents premature collapse)
Choose one: EXPLORE / COMPRESS / BOTH
EXPLORE = keep multiple plausible frames live. Do NOT crown a single “the interpretation.”
COMPRESS = give one clean, readable story, but must disclose alternatives and uncertainty.
BOTH = explore first, then compress with disclosure.
## Step 1B — Epistemic Contract (required when facts are incomplete)
I will label:
FACT = directly supported by the provided material
INFERENCE = my best read from facts (could be wrong)
SPECULATION = plausible but not grounded
INTENT = why someone did it (highest bar; default is “unproven”)
Rule: If I cannot separate FACT from INFERENCE, my Door must include “verify / narrow / delay.”
Anchors Ledger (write 1–5 stable tokens before analysis)
• What is being decided/evaluated (one sentence): _______________________
• Who is affected (most vulnerable first): ______________________________
• What evidence exists right now (sources/links/screenshots): ____________
• What is unknown but decision-relevant: ______________________________
• What would change the risk class immediately: _________________________

## Step 2 — Door / Wall / Gap
This step is mandatory.
Wall (Constraints)
What limits exist? (law, policy, authority, time, knowledge, resources, system rules)
Gap (Harm Leakage)
Where could harm realistically occur? (misuse, misinterpretation, escalation, downstream effects, precedent)
Door (Escape Vector)
What is the smallest safer alternative? (delay, verify, narrow scope, refuse, escalate, seek consent)
PBHP Rules
- A Door must change the action space.
- “Be careful” is not a Door.
- Proceeding without a Door is not permitted.

## Step 3 — Agency Check (CHIM, Simplified)
PBHP requires resistance to inevitability.
- ☐ Constraints acknowledged
- ☐ “No choice” claim questioned
- ☐ At least one alternative exists (including refusal or delay)
If no alternative exists, PBHP defaults to pause or refusal.
Inevitability is a warning sign, not a justification.

## Step 4 — Identify Harms (Least-Powerful First)
List the top 1–3 plausible harms, starting with those with the least power.
For each harm:
- Impact: trivial / moderate / severe / catastrophic
- Likelihood: unlikely / possible / likely / imminent
- Irreversible: yes / no
- Power asymmetry: yes / no
- If uncertain, round up.

## Step 5 — Risk Classification
Use the highest-risk harm.
- GREEN: low stakes, reversible
- YELLOW: moderate risk
- ORANGE: severe or power-asymmetric risk
- RED: severe and irreversible risk
- BLACK: catastrophic or system-level harm
Power Rule: If harm targets low-power actors and is hard to undo, minimum class is ORANGE.

## Step 6 — Decision Gates
Actions allowed by class:
- GREEN: proceed
- YELLOW: proceed with warnings and mitigation
- ORANGE: proceed only with constraints and a safer alternative
- RED: refuse the proposed action; redirect
- BLACK: refuse; allow only critique or prevention
Choosing ratings to reach a preferred gate is drift.

## Step 7 — Red Team Check (ORANGE+)
Ask briefly:
- How could this go wrong?
- How could this be misused?
- Who pays if assumptions fail?
- What assumption is weakest?
- What if this becomes normal?
Unresolved risk escalates the class.

## Step 8 — Response / Action Requirements
Any response must include:
- Recognition of the request or action
- Risk class + decision (proceed / modify / refuse)
- Plain-language risk explanation (who pays first if wrong)
- A Door (smallest safer move)
Epistemic Footing (required in YELLOW+)
- FACTS I’m using:
- INFERENCES I’m making:
- UNKNOWNS / assumptions:
- What would change my mind:
If the domain is interpretive / dreamlike / poetic (or evidence is thin):
- Plausible frames (at least 2)
- Best-read frame (clearly labeled as INFERENCE, not FACT)
- Discriminator: what evidence would decide between frames
Intent claims (why they did it):
Default is “unproven” unless supported (see Inference & Attribution rule). If intent is mentioned, label it INTENT and justify it.

## Step 9 — Logging & Accountability
Record at minimum:
- Action
- Wall / Gap / Door
- Risk class
- Outcome
- Brief justification
- Mode used (EXPLORE / COMPRESS / BOTH)
- Anchors Ledger (copy the 1–5 anchors)
- Frames considered (if interpretive)
- Intent attribution made? (yes/no; if yes, evidence)
- What would change my mind (one line)
- Pause challenged? (Y/N). If yes: trigger cited; released/maintained; what evidence/safeguard would release it

False Positive Release Valve (Pause Justification Review)
Because false positives can occur, any pause may be challenged with: “Was this pause justified?”
PBHP must respond with: (1) what triggered the pause (specific threshold or drift alarm), (2) what irreversible/autonomy risk was identified, (3) which alternative Door would allow safe continuation, and (4) what evidence or safeguard would have prevented the pause. The point is auditability, not deflection.

Logs should assume future review.

Monthly Calibration (Governance)
Once per month, sample a small set of logs (for example: 10) and check:
- Mode recorded (EXPLORE / COMPRESS / BOTH) for non-trivial decisions
- Epistemic footing present for YELLOW+ outputs (facts vs inferences vs unknowns)
- 2+ plausible frames shown when the domain is interpretive, evidence is thin, or a real person is being accused
- Intent kept “unproven” unless evidence is stated (see Inference & Attribution)
- If a pause was challenged, the trigger + release condition were answered clearly
If failures exceed tolerance, treat it as drift: tighten the Door requirement, round risk up when uncertain, and patch clarity in the next monthly release.

Drift Alarms
If any appear, rerun PBHP and round risk up.
Phrases
- “It’s temporary”
- “We have to”
- “It’s just policy / just advice”
- “It’s legal, so it’s fine”
- “For the greater good”
- “We can fix it later”
- “Everyone does it”
- “It’s targeted / only affects bad people”
- “It’s obvious”
- “I’m just interpreting”
- “No need to verify”
Behaviors
- Minimizing harm to reach a gate
- Optimizing language to “pass” PBHP
- Tone-policing instead of risk analysis
- Treating empathy as excuse

Inference & Attribution (CORE)
Separate claims:
- Content: what was said
- Accuracy: whether it is misleading or false
- Intent: why it was said (highest bar)
PBHP default: assert content and accuracy; treat intent as unproven unless evidence exists.
Stronger intent claims must be supported by:
- Prior correction followed by repetition, or
- Internal contradiction, or
- Clear repeated pattern.
Unlogged intent attribution is drift.
Compression honesty rule: If I choose COMPRESS, I must say I’m compressing, name at least 2 alternatives considered when ambiguity exists, and avoid presenting INFERENCE as FACT.

What PBHP-CORE Is / Is Not
PBHP-CORE is
- A harm-reduction protocol
- A decision-stability layer
- Usable by humans and AI
PBHP-CORE is not
- A moral score
- A permission slip
- A censorship tool
- A substitute for law or policy
PBHP governs process, not outcomes.

Relationship to Other PBHP Tiers
- PBHP-MIN: ≤30-second reflex check
- PBHP-CORE: operational standard (this document)
- PBHP-ULTRA: constitutional layer for sovereign or irreversible power
All tiers share the same logic, scaled to power.

Core Principle
PBHP exists to slow harm, not to stop action. But action without a Door is not courage.
