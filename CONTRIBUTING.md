# Contributing to PBHP

Thank you for your interest in improving the Pause Before Harm Protocol.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and questions
- Include specific examples when possible
- For security vulnerabilities, email pausebeforeharmprotocol_pbhp@protonmail.com directly

### Submitting Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-improvement`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test with the self-test rubric (`implementation/PBHP_IMPLEMENTATION_SELF_TEST.md`)
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### What We're Looking For
- **Edge cases** that break the framework — real scenarios where Wall/Gap/Door produces wrong answers
- **Domain-specific Doors** — safer alternatives for specific industries or use cases
- **Adversarial patterns** — new social engineering techniques targeting AI agents
- **Production feedback** — what works, what doesn't, what's missing
- **Case studies** — documented PBHP usage (successes and failures)
- **Translations** — making the protocol accessible in other languages

### What We're NOT Looking For
- Changes that make the core protocol longer than ~100 lines (brevity is a feature)
- Vendor-specific integrations in the core (keep it model-agnostic)
- Theoretical frameworks without practical application

## Code of Conduct
